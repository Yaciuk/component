# Lucera Front End Assessment

Thank you for your interest in applying to the Wordpress team at Lucera! We ask that you please keep this project private.

## Project intro

Please build a "services" component, which provides users with more information on a sample business's core services. We would like you to build this using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (or jQuery, if you prefer). Bonus points for cross-browser compatibility, performance optimizations, and accessibility. Project details and specifications are provided below.

If you have any questions, please contact Eduardo Cacas at ecacas@bgcpartners.com.

- Mobile, open: see provided image

## Project specifications

- The entire service item constitutes a clickable area (image and text)
- On item click, a detail section appears beneath, with more information. This should slide down/reveal with some animation. On desktop, the detail section appears beneath the entire service section. On mobile, the section appears beneath the active item. Only one detail section can appear at a time.
- Images and icons can be downloaded via the "desktop, open" XD file, and can be resized/cropped if you prefer. 
- In lieu of the font (Aktiv Grotesk), please use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

## Technical requirements

- This assessment is fairly open, as we'd like to let you determine the stack and structure. The only requirement is that you must use a bundler, but the choice of bundler is up to you.
- The `src` directory should contain all your development files
- The `public` directory should contain only the files necessary for production. You should be able to view `lucera-assessment/public/index.html` on your browser/local environment, without requiring anything from the `src` directory.

## Deliverable

Once finished, please remove your `node_modules` directory, if it exists, and email a zipped version of this project to Eduardo Cacas at ecacas@bgcpartners.com. You can include any notes about your project and your process in the provided markdown file.
